1.set-user-ID and set-group-ID can grant the access of "this file" to the "someone" who executes( or use) this "this file" to do something.
This someone starts a process which related to "this file", and the owner of "this file" grant the access of the file to "this someone".

2. The read permission for the directory is to read the entry in the directory. And the execution permission for a directory is "searcheable"
permission for a directory. If we don't have x permission for a dir, but if we have r permission, we can also read the entry in the dir.
But we can't not "ls -l" the entries under this dir. Only we have 'x' and 'w' permission, we can create new files in the dir. 
If the 'sticky bit' is set for the dir and the user has 'w' permission, only if the user satisfyies one of the following conditions
• Owns the file
• Owns the directory
• Is the superuser
Then the user can rename and delete the file in the dir.
